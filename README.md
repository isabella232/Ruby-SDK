This project uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) for managing
backwards-compatibility.

> **NOTE:** Version 0.4.0 is not strictly backwards-compatible with the earlier 0.0.x versions.

> **NOTE:** Due to impending PCI 3.x changes, we will be disabling support for TLS < 1.2 over our API. TLS 1.2 support requires Ruby 2.0.0. As such, while this SDK may function with Ruby 1.9, we no longer support it.

* [API Reference](https://wepay.github.io/Ruby-SDK/)

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'wepay', '~> 0.4.0'
```

And include it in your scripts:

```ruby
require 'wepay'
```

## Examples

```ruby
client_id = 'your_client_id'
client_secret = 'your_client_secret'
use_stage = true

wepay = WePay::Client.new(client_id, client_secret, use_stage)

# Get the OAuth 2.0 authorization URL. Send the user to this URL to authorize
# the application, then they will return to your `redirect_uri` with a code as
# a GET parameter.
redirect_uri = "http://myexamplesite.com/wepay"
redirect_to(wepay.oauth2_authorize_url(redirect_uri))

# Once you have the OAuth 2.0 code, you can request an access token.
response = wepay.oauth2_token(code, redirect_uri)
access_token = response['access_token']

# Make a call to the `/user` endpoint (which requires no parameters).
response = wepay.call('/user', access_token)

# You may also open a payment account for the user.
response = wepay.call('/account/create', access_token, {
  :name        => "test account",
  :description => "this is only a test"
})
```

## Testing

Firstly, run `bundle install` to download and install the dependencies.

You can run the tests as follows:

```bash
make test
```


## API Reference

The API Reference is generated by a tool called [YARD](http://yardoc.org). Once it's installed, you can generate
updated documentation by running the following command in the root of the repository.

```bash
make docs
```
